This repo contains profootballReferenceScrape.py, which contains
functions for scraping data from pro-football-reference.com. These
functions allow one to download and organize massive amounts of
football data quickly. On 2017-03-31 I added play-by-play.py, which
downloads play-by-play from all games in the regular season for a year
passed to the function. The play-by-play.py does not currently run
from the command line, but it will soon.  

The scripts were written in Python 3.5.
The following packages are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- re
- requests
- bs4


If you are new to Python, I recommend installing the Anaconda distribution:

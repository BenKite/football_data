This repo contains profootballReferenceScrape.py, which contains
functions for scraping data from pro-football-reference.com. This
functions allow one to download and organize massive amounts of
football data quickly.

The script was written in Python 3.5.
The following packages are required:
- pandas
- re
- requests
- bs4


If you are new to Python, I recommend installing the Anaconda distribution:
